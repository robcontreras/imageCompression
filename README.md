# Image Compression Swift Script

This is a very basic image compression script i made after watching [Ayaka Nonaka](http://twitter.com/ayanonagon)’s talk on [Swift Scripting](http://realm.io/news/swift-scripting/).

### Usage

```
$: ./imageCompression.swift images_folder_name
```


The images folder has to be in the same directory as the script for now.

A new folder will be created inside the images folder called *’Compressed’* where the new images will be created. The original images will remain in the images folder.
